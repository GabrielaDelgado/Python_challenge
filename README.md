Python Challenge

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

This project was meant to look at real world situations using Python to analyze the data and write an analysis based on the results found. This project includes this read me file and the scripts written.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the Python code into the repository

Python

I used Python to complete two chanllenges: PyBank and PyPoll. The PyBank analyzes financial data while the PyPoll looks into the data of the elections in a small town. Python was used to get total numbers, changes in the dataset, averages, max and min values, lists, percentages, and the winner of the elections.

Acknoledgements:

Tutor Nelson Tsai for answering my questions about VS Code to be able to run the code and get into the correct files. And, for going over Git Bash with me
